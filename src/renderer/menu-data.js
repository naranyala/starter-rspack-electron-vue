It combines the Chromium rendering engine and the Node.js runtime.</p><p>With Electron, you can develop desktop applications that run on Windows, macOS, and Linux using familiar web technologies. Popular applications like Visual Studio Code, Slack, Discord, and WhatsApp Desktop are built with Electron.</p>',

The Renderer Process renders the UI and runs in the browser window.</p><p>Communication between processes happens via IPC (Inter-Process Communication). This architecture allows for secure separation of concerns while maintaining flexibility.</p>',
